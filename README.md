# Forex_Candlestick_Data
Downloads live and historical forex data using python
Using python3 and oanda-demo-account-rest-api(free and very cool resource), anyone will be able to obtain 
live prices, historical prices, or live w/ historical prices. The output from this python script will produce 28
csv files containing all possible main forex pairs and trading pair combinations.

Once the data has been obtained, it can be used for machine learning or algorithmic trading purposes.
